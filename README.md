# Space-debris
Identifying Space Debris using U.S military APIs

- There are several satellite tracking databases that provide this information, such as the Space-Track website operated by the United States military. We can use the `urllib` library in Python to retrieve the data from these databases in the form of a file or API.



- Next, we need to parse the data to extract the relevant information on the space debris. This will typically include the time of the observation, the orbital elements (e.g., semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination), and the object's identifier (e.g., NORAD catalog number). We use Python's `csv` library to parse the data if it is in a comma-separated values (CSV) format, or we can use specialized libraries such as pandas to read and manipulate the data.



- Once we extracted the necessary information, we use it to calculate the position of the space debris. The position of an object in orbit can be determined using its orbital elements and the time of observation. We implement Python's `math` library to perform the calculations, or we use specialized libraries such as `pyorbit` or `poliastro` that provide functions to perform these calculations more easily.



- Finally, we visualize the position of the space debris on a plot or map. We can use Python's `matplotlib` library to create plots, or we use libraries such as `cartopy` or` basemap` to create maps.
